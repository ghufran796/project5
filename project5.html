            <h2>Why Cats are the best animals</h2>
            <p>Cats are great companions for any person </i>as they are loyal.
                Cats have a sense of time but don’t understand 
                the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, Cats don’t have the ability to create actual measures 
                of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to read clocks. So, 
                telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that you
                 feel like you have to do it anyway! Cats are capable of being trained based on past events, 
                 and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s Cats are 
                 the perfect example of this.</p>

                <P>The Cats is a domesticated descendant of the Wild cats like tigers . Also called the domestic Cats, 
                    it is derived from extinct Pleistocene tigers, and the modern tigers is the cat's 
                    nearest living relative. Cats were the onw of the species to be domesticated 
                    by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of agriculture.</P>
